      "#### Preparation Instructions:  \n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Prepare the Moussaka:**  \n",
      "   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  \n",
      "   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices until they are golden brown on both sides. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.  \n",
