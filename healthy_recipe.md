- 1 tbsp olive oil

#### Preparation Instructions:  

**1. Prepare the Vegetarian Moussaka:**  
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices until they are golden brown on both sides. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.  
   - In the same skillet, add more olive oil if necessary and sauté the chopped onion until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.  
   - Stir in the cooked lentils, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, allspice, and vegetable broth (if using). Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens.  
   - In a separate pot, boil the potato slices until tender but not mushy. Drain and set aside.  
   - In a greased baking dish, layer half of the potato slices at the bottom, followed by half of the eggplant, then the lentil sauce, and finally the remaining eggplant. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top and sprinkle with grated vegan cheese.  
   - Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.  

**2. Prepare the Greek Salad:**  
   - In a large bowl, combine the diced cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, and Kalamata olives.  
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour over the salad and toss gently.  
   - Add crumbled vegan feta cheese on top just before serving, if using.  

**3. Prepare the Tzatziki Sauce:**  
   - In a bowl, combine plant-based yogurt, grated cucumber (drained), minced garlic, olive oil, dill, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate until ready to serve.  

#### Serving Suggestions:  
- Serve the vegetarian moussaka warm, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.  
- Place a generous scoop of Greek salad on the side.  
- Serve tzatziki sauce in a small bowl for dipping or drizzling over the moussaka and salad.  
- Pair with crusty bread or pita for a complete meal.  

Enjoy your delicious and hearty vegetarian Greek dinner with family and friends!
