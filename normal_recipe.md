#### Preparation Instructions:  

**1. Prepare the Moussaka:**  
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices until they are golden brown on both sides. Set aside on paper towels to drain excess oil.  
   - In the same skillet, add more olive oil if necessary and sauté the chopped onion until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.  
   - Add the ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.  
   - Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, allspice, and red wine (if using). Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens.  
   - In a separate pot, boil the potato slices until tender but not mushy. Drain and set aside.  
   - In a greased baking dish, layer half of the potato slices at the bottom, followed by half of the eggplant, then the meat sauce, and finally the remaining eggplant. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.  
   - Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.  

**2. Prepare the Greek Salad:**  
   - In a large bowl, combine the diced cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, and Kalamata olives.  
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour over the salad and toss gently.  
   - Add crumbled feta cheese on top just before serving.  

**3. Prepare the Tzatziki Sauce:**  
   - In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt, grated cucumber (drained), minced garlic, olive oil, dill, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate until ready to serve.  

#### Serving Suggestions:  
- Serve the moussaka warm, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.  
- Place a generous scoop of Greek salad on the side.  
- Serve tzatziki sauce in a small bowl for dipping or drizzling over the moussaka and salad.  
- Pair with crusty bread or pita for a complete meal.  

Enjoy your delicious Greek dinner with family and friends!
